# My Scene Manager [WIP]

This is a simple tool to manage your game scenes.

## Click on the buttons to load the scene right away.
## You can rename the scene right away by clicking on the pencil icon.
## Yellow text on button indicates that that scene is added to the build settings.

This is compatible with the 5.2 version not yet supported for 5.2.x+ versions.
